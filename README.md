## Guide through branches

The `master` branch contains code without any contanerization. It's possible to run it locally, just by running each of the application.
Docker, docker-compose, Kubernetes configuration files are located in a separate branches, so it's possible to compare the changes related to each of the modifications.
Othe significat changes are stored in separate branches also. This is done for cleaner representation of each of the configurations.
